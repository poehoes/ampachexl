<div class="title">What is Ampache?</div><ul>
<li><a href="http://ampache.org/" target="_blank">Ampache</a> is a web based audio/video streaming application and file manager allowing you to access your music & videos from anywhere, using almost any internet enabled device.</li>

</ul><hr /><div class="title">How is Ampache different than the "cloud" music players from Google, Amazon and others?</div><ul>
<li>With Ampache all of your music is streamed directly from your server to your device.  The music is not copied to any other server in the cloud.  There are no restrictions on the number or length of songs you can have and there is never any cost for the service itself.  And it is really easy to share your music collection with others.</li>

</ul><hr /><div class="title">What does this app do?</div><ul>
<li>Ampache XL is a webOS app for the Touchpad that allows you to play back music from you Ampache server.  Future versions of the app will support playing back videos and saving songs from Ampache to your device.</li>

</ul><hr /><div class="title">How do I get started?</div><ul>
<li>You need to have Ampache up and running on your computer for this app to work.  Once you have Ampache setup you will need to setup the ACL to allow the app access to your library.  Setting up an Ampache system is not hard process, but it is not a trivial task either.  The app <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ampache-mobile/" target="_blank">Ampache Mobile</a> (no affiliation) has some good information on getting started.</li>

</ul><hr /><div class="title">Can I play back videos that are on my Ampache system?</div><ul>
<li>The app will try to stream any videos that are available on your Ampache system, but the TouchPad only support certain video types so not all of your videos may actually be playable.</li>

</ul><hr /><div class="title">What is the app's homepage?</div><ul>
<li>It is right <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ampachexl/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

</ul><hr /><div class="title">Is there anyway I can help out?</div><ul>
<li>Yes.  I would be happy to have anyone add to the app that wants to.  The two areas I would appreciate the most help on are style/theming and any language translations.  Though any type of help would be welcome.  Email the developer <a href="mailto:ampachexl.help@gmail.com?subject=AmpacheXL Help">here</a> to get started.</li>

</ul><hr /><div class="title">If I have a problem with using the app should I just write a negative review where the developer can't contact me?</div><ul>
<li>No.  If you have a legitimate issue with the app and want to get it resolved try reaching out to the developer.  You can leave whatever review you want for the app, but if you want to help make the app better for yourself and others try contacting the developer.</li>

</ul><hr /><div class="title">What if I have some other question and/or suggestion?</div><ul>
<li>You can always email the developer <a href="mailto:ampachexl.help@gmail.com?subject=AmpacheXL Help">here</a> or find him on twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/webmyth_dev">@webmyth_dev</a>.</li>
